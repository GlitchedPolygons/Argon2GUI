# Argon2 GUI

Argon2 GUI is an easy, minimal and user friendly graphical user interface around the open-source crypto library
"Argon2", which is written entirely in [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) and 
[Apache-2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) / 
[CC0-1.0](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0) dual-licensed, available on 
[github.com/P-H-C/phc-winner-argon2](https://github.com/P-H-C/phc-winner-argon2).

It's very handy for usage during development and/or for testing and implementing web services of any kind where 
passwords are involved.

Argon2 is a great way of hashing passwords. **Never** store passwords in plaintext!
